    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Why I am at MATC:</h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">I spent my freshman year at UW-Milwaukee not sure what I wanted to do. I've always been the "tech" guy for my family and friends. Fixing their devices or troubleshooting applications. I loved it. So I knew I wanted to do something in that direction. I thought about computer engineering and computer science, which are great paths, but I didn't feel like I really fit in those programs. I eventually stumbled on an unfamiliar, at-the-time, program. Information Technology. It fascinated me. I was extremely interested from the get-go and I went all in.</p>
    <p>Out of curiosity, I began to look at IT programs in other colleges and universities. That's when I stumbled on MATC's Information Technology programs. Yes, programs. MATC has specialized programs such as, networking, comptuter support, web developement, security, and mobile application developement. I felt especially interested in networking, so I transferred to MATC. I love how invested they are in IT and how easily they break it up so that you can really focus on what you WANT to learn.</p>
